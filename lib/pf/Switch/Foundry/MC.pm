=head1 NAME

pf::Switch::Foundry::MC 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The pf::Switch::Foundry::MC module implements an object oriented interface
to manage Foundry's Mobility Controllers (MC) via Telnet/SSH

=head1 STATUS

Although we have never tested a Foundry Mobility Controller, 
we have reason to believe that it might work with Meru's code as-is.

Please let us know if you have access to such hardware and can validate our claims.
